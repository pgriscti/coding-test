![Coding Exercise wireframe](/coding-exercise.png)


The data is a list of application records and is fetchable at `/data`. Each application has 3 levels.
Important: Use the data file provided

The app should -

- Requests the dataset.
- Build a hierarchical navigation tree displaying the different levels of business capabilities. Bonus points if we can expand/collapse the navigation tree.
- Have a range slider to be able to further filter the dataset based on the total spending value
- Present a list of applications from the data set, showing name and total spend. The list depends on the navigation tree and the range filter 

Additional notes
